# Does not work at this time.... its now uploaded for working reasons


In Order to run this program from GIT-HUB released sourcecode you need 
geckodriver in same folder structure i created here. 
If you runing on Windows you ned 
Microsoft Visual C++ Runtimeenvironment as well.  
(for the geckodriver)
You get it from Microsoft Support Page:
"https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads"

All the rest to say is in the code as well,
I appreciate commends and hints, support i dont need at this point

best regards
