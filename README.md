In Order to run this program from GIT-HUB released sourcecode you have to download, geckodriver
and to put it at "./geckolinux/geckodriver", or "./geckowin/geckodriver.exe"
i was not sure if i am aloud to upload it here myself, so i excluded it.

All the rest to say is in the code as well,
I appreciate commends and hints, support i dont need at this point

best regards
