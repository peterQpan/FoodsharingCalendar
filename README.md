In Order to run this program from GIT-HUB released sourcecode you have to download, geckodriver
and to put it at "./geckolinux/geckodriver", or "./geckowin/geckodriver.exe"
i was not sure if i am aloud to upload it here myself, so i excluded it.

Update Insertion:
I forgot to mention here, that you need Microsoft C++ Runtime Environment as well,
and in the start screen of the program itself,
i obviously forgot to mention the geckodriver, 
well i will fix this at the next WE.

thx and best regards!!!

All the rest to say is in the code as well,
I appreciate commends and hints, support i dont need at this point

best regards
